If you choose RSA over AES in the API, it means you'll use a pair of keys (public and private) for secure communication. Clients get the server's public key to encrypt a secret key, and the server, with its private key, decrypts that secret key. RSA is good for secure sharing without a shared secret, but it's a bit slower and more complex. You'll need to manage keys carefully. I think for this specific api RSA would be the better alternative to AES as it's more secure and as the server key is small in size hence it won't be an issue for the RSA's complex algorithm.
